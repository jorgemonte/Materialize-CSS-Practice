#MyFrameworkPractice - MaterializeCSS

This is just part of my exercises to learn the documentation of this framework.

When I try to learn a new framework I try to pass by all its documentation and write them line by line, it helps me to keep in memory all (or most of) the capabilities of that framework.

Of course the goal is not to memorize the documentation, but be able to know if something is possible to be done at that framework or not, and I just need to do a quick search at the documentation looking for what I need.
